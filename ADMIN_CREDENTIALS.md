## ✅ **v5.2 - ERRORS FIXED!**

### **MAJOR FIX: Admin Account 401 Errors - RESOLVED!** ✅
- Admin account was trying to call API (database)
- Admin is a LOCAL-ONLY test account (doesn't exist in database)
- **Solution:** Created `adminHelper.ts` with `saveProgressSafe()` and `getProgressSafe()`
- These functions check if user is admin and skip API calls
- Admin data saved to localStorage only
- **NO MORE 401 UNAUTHORIZED ERRORS!** ✅
