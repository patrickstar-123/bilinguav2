# ✨ What's Fixed & New in BilinguaV2

## 🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIXED ✅

### **Quiz/Exam Answer Bug - SOLVED!**

**Problem:** Wrong answers were being marked as correct, and correct answers were being marked as wrong.

**Cause:** The app was shuffling answer options AFTER calculating which option was correct, causing the correct answer index to point to the wrong option.

**Solution:** Fixed the question generator to shuffle options FIRST, then calculate which one is correct.

**Result:** 
- ✅ All Chinese (HSK) quizzes now show correct answers
- ✅ All Japanese (JLPT) quizzes now show correct answers  
- ✅ Exams are now accurate
- ✅ You can trust the results!
